    "- Markv Chain methods apply equally well to directed and to undirected models. The algo is easier to present in the context of a distribution $P_\\Phi$ defined in terms of a general set of factors $\\Phi$.\n",
    "- To apply Gibbs Sampling to a network with evidence, we first reduce all of the factors by the observatiosn $\\mathbf{e}$, so that the distribution $P_\\Phi$ used in the algorithm corresponds to $P_\\Phi(\\mathbf{X}|\\mathbf{e})$.\n",
    "- Markov Chain: a Markov chain is defined in terms of a graph of states over which the sampling algorithm takes a random walk. In the case of graphical models, this graph is not the original graph, but rather a graph whose nodes are the possible assignments to our variables $\\mathbf{X}$.\n",
    "- Markov chain Monte carlo (MCMC) sampling is a process that mirrors the dynamics of the Markov chain; the process of generating an MCMC trajectory is shown in algorithm 12.5. The sample $\\mathbf{x}^{(t)}$ is drawn from the distribution $P^{(t)}$. We are interested in the limit of this process, that is, whether $P^{(t)}$ converges, and if so, to what limit.\n",
    "- We have that $P^{(t+1)}(\\mathbf{x}') = \\sum_{\\mathbf{x} \\in Val(\\mathbf{X})}P^{(t)}(\\mathbf{x})\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbf{x}\\rightarrow \\mathbf{x'})$\n",
    "- For large $t$, we expect $P^{(t)}(\\mathbf{x}') \\approx P^{(t+1)}(\\mathbf{x}')$. Whatever distribution that makes this work is called an invariant distribution. We may refer to it with $\\pi(\\mathbf{x}')$\n",
    "- There is no guarantee that the stationary distribution is unique. Sometimes it depends on the starting state. Situtations like this occer when the chain has several distinct regions that are not reachable from each other. Chains such as this are called *reducible Markov Chains*. Also, it may be due to a fixed cycle behavior. These are called periodic Markov Chains.\n",
    "- We want to restrict attention to Markov Chains that have a unique stationary distributions which is reached from *any* starting distribution $P^{(0)}$. The most commonly used condition to guarantee this behavior is that the chain is *ergodic*.\n",
    "- Ergodic: When the state space $Val(\\mathbf{X})$ is finite, it's equivalent (though not defined this way?) is: A markov chain is said to be *regular* if there exists some number $k$ such that for every $\\mathbf{x}', \\mathbf{x} \\in Val(\\mathbf{X})$, the probability of getting from $\\mathbf{x}$ to $\\mathbf{x}'$ in exactly $k$ steps is greater than zero.\n",
    "- Theorem: if a finite state Markov Chain $\\mathcal{T}$ is regular, then it has a unique stationaty distribution.\n",
    "- Ensuring regularity is usually easy - you need two conditions\"\n",
    "    - it is possible to get from any state to any state using a positive probability path in the state graph\n",
    "    - There is a non-zero chance of remaining on a state for all sates\n",
    "- Those two conditions are sufficient but not necessary. They typcally hold in practice.\n",
    "- For graphical models, each state is an assignment to many variables. When defining a transition model over this sapce, we can consider a fully general case, when a transition is from any state to any other state. However, it is often convenient to decompose the transition model, considering transition that update only a single component of the state vector at a time, ther is, only a value for a single variable.\n",
    "    - Consider an extension to our Grasshopper chain, where the grasshopper lives, not on a line, but in a two-dimensional plane. In this case, the state of the system is defined via a pair of random variables $X$; $Y$ . Although we could define a joint transition model over both dimensions simultaneously, it might be easier to have separate transition models for the $X$ and $Y$ coordinate.\n",
    "- In such a case, we often define a set of transition models: $\\mathcal{T}_i$, called kernels. These may help us guarantee regularity or speed convergence. To sample, we have to add an intermediate step to sample which $\\mathcal{T}_i$. All of them together we can think define a global $\\mathcal{T}$.\n",
    "- The Gibbs Chain is not necessarily regular! Whoa! However, it is if the distribution is positive. However, positivity is not a requirement.\n",
    "- Gibbs sampling may take a long time to mix.\n",
    "- It is NOT the case that Gibbs Sampling and the MH algorithm satisfy the desired properties of markov chain\n",
    "- Picking samples at a distance is provably worse than using all samples!\n"

    "\"The task of using a given graphical model of a system, complete with fitted parameters, to answer certain questions regarding that system.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll discuss a general class designed to *approximate* these answers with simulations. That is, we'll get a set of samples drawn from a distribution which approximates the distribution we're asking about.\n",

    "Due to one reason only, I enjoy these techniques the most. It's their *generality*. Exact inference algorithms demand the graphs are sufficiently simple and factorizable. Variable Inference (a type of approximate approach[link to answer 3]) demands defining approximate distribution spaces and a means to search them effectively. Monte Carlo methods, however, demand no qualifying inspection of these graph - all graphs are fair game. This provides us with a much wider class of models to fit our reality.\n",

    "### Refresher (same as refresher in answer 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first answer [link], we discovered why PGMs are useful tools for representing complex system. We defined a complex system as a set of $n$ random variables (which we call $\\mathcal{X}$) with a relationship we'd like to understand. We take it that there exists some true but unknown joint distribution, $P$, which govern these RVs. We take it that a 'good understanding' means we can answer two types of questions regarding this $P$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Probability Queries**: Compute the probabilities $P(\\mathbf{Y}|\\mathbf{e})$. What is the distribution of the RV's of $\\mathbf{Y}$ given we have some observation ($\\mathbf{e}$) of the RVs of $\\mathbf{E}$?\n",
    "2. **MAP Queries**: Determine $\\textrm{argmax}_\\mathbf{Y}P(\\mathbf{Y}|\\mathbf{e})$. That is, determine the most likely values of some RVs given an assignment of other RVs.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Where $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{Y}$ are two arbitrary subsets of $\\mathcal{X}$. If this notation is unfamiliar, see the 'Notation Guide' section from the first answer [link]).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind PGMs is to estimate $P$ using two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A graph: a set of nodes, each of which represents an RV from $\\mathcal{X}$, and a set of edges between these nodes.\n",
    "2. Parameters: objects that, when paired with a graph and a certain rule, allow us to calculate probabilities of assignments of $\\mathcal{X}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "PGMs fall into two main categories, Bayesian Networks ('BNs') and Markov Networks ('MNs'), depending on the specifics of these two.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Bayesian Network** involves a graph, denoted as $\\mathcal{G}$, with *directed* edges and no directed cycles. The parameters are Conditional Probability Tables ('CPDs' or 'CPTs'), which are, as the naming suggests, select conditional probabilities from the BN. They give us the right hand side of the Chain Rule, which dictates we calculate probabilities according to a BN:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_{B}(X_1,\\cdots,X_n)=\\prod_{i=1}^n P_{B}(X_i|\\textrm{Pa}_{X_i}^\\mathcal{G})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Markov Network**'s graph, denoted as $\\mathcal{H}$, is different in that it's edges are *undirected* and we may have cycles. The parameters are a size $m$ set of *functions* which map assignments of $m$ subsets of $\\mathcal{X}$ to nonnegative numbers. Those subsets, which we'll call $\\mathbf{D}_i$'s, correspond to *complete subgraphs* of $\\mathcal{H}$ and their union makes up the whole of $\\mathcal{H}$. We can refer to this set as $\\Phi=\\{\\phi_i(\\cdots)\\}_{i=1}^m$. With that, we say that the 'Gibbs Rule' for calculation probabilities is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_M(X_1,\\cdots,X_n) = \\frac{1}{Z} \\underbrace{\\prod_{i = 1}^m \\phi_i(\\mathbf{D}_i)}_{\\text{we call this }\\tilde{P}_M(X_1,\\cdots,X_n)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Z$ is a normalizer - it ensures our probabilities sum to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "To crystallize this idea, it's helpful to imagine the 'Gibbs Table', which lists unnormalized probabilities for all assignments. In the second answer [link], we pictured an example where $\\mathcal{X}=\\{C,D,I,G,S\\}$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Title](GIbbsTable_labeled.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we recall that the Gibbs Rule may expression the Chain Rule. That is, we can always recreate the probabilities produced by a BN's Chain Rule with an another invented MN and its Gibbs Rule. Essentially, we define factors as those that reproduce looking up a conditional probability in a BN's CPDs. This equivalence allows us to reason solely in terms of the Gibbs Rule, while assured that whatever we discover will also hold for BNs. In other words, with regards to inference, if something works for $P_M$, then it works for $P_B$."

    "### What's our starting point?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are handed a MN (or a BN that we'll convert to an MN). That is, we get a graph $\\mathcal{H}$ and a set of factors $\\Phi$. We're interested in the distribution of a subset of RVs, $\\mathbf{Y} \\subset \\mathcal{X}$, conditional on an observation of other RVs ($\\mathbf{E}=\\mathbf{e}$). We'll have our answer presumably (to both queries) if we can generate samples, $\\mathbf{y}$'s, that come (approximately) from this distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to address conditioning. To do so, let's steal one idea that appeared in the second answer. That is, inference in a MN conditional on $\\mathbf{E}=\\mathbf{e}$ gives the same answer as *unconditional* inference in a specially defined MN, with a graph we'll call $\\mathcal{H}_{|\\mathbf{e}}$ and a set of factors $\\Phi_{|\\mathbf{e}}$. $\\mathcal{H}_{|\\mathbf{e}}$ is $\\mathcal{H}$, but with all $\\mathbf{E}$ nodes and any edges involving them deleted. $\\Phi_{|\\mathbf{e}}$ is the set of factors $\\Phi$, but with $\\mathbf{E}=\\mathbf{e}$ fixed as an input assignment. The point is if we can do unconditional inference, we can do conditional inference. For the sake of cleaniness, I'll drop the '$|\\mathbf{e}$' subscript and take it that you realize we've already done the conditioning conversion. \n",

    "### Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, MCMC finds a way to *sequentially* sample $\\mathbf{y}$'s such that, eventually, these $\\mathbf{y}$'s are distributed as $P_M(\\mathbf{Y}|\\mathbf{e})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this, we must first defined a **Markov Chain**. All this is is a set of states and transition probabilities defined between such states. These probabilities are the chances we transition to any other state given the current state. For our purposes, the set of states is $Val(\\mathbf{X})$ where $\\mathbf{X}=\\mathcal{X}$ - all possible joint assignments of all variables. For any two states $\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}' \\in Val(\\mathbf{X})$, we write the transition probability as $\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x}')$. We may refer to all such probabilities or the whole Markov Chain as $\\mathcal{T}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a simple example, suppose our system was one RV, $X$, that could take 3 possible values (so $Val(X)=[x^1,x^2,x^3])$. Then we might have this Markov Chain:\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](MarkovChainExample.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking generally again,  to 'sample' a Markov Chain means we sample a starting $\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}\\in Val(\\mathbf{X})$ according to some starting distribution that we'll call $P_\\mathcal{T}^{(0)}$. Then, we use our $\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x}')$ probabilities to determine the next state, giving us $\\mathbf{x}^{(1)}$. Then we repeat, giving us a long series of $\\mathbf{x}^{(t)}$'s. If we were to restarting the sampling procedure many times and select out the $t$-th sample, we'd observe a distribution that we'll call $P_\\mathcal{T}^{(t)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, a sample of our toy examples might be: $x^1$ (33% chance) $\\rightarrow x^3$ (75% chance) $\\rightarrow x^2$ (50%) $\\rightarrow x^2$ (70%). Simple enough, right?\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for a large $t$, it's reasonable to expect $P_\\mathcal{T}^{(t)}(\\mathbf{x})$ to be very similar to $P_\\mathcal{T}^{(t+1)}(\\mathbf{x})$. Under some conditions, that's correct intuition. Whatever that common distribution is, we call it the **stationary distribution** of $\\mathcal{T}$, and it's written as $\\pi_\\mathcal{T}$. It is the *single* distribution that works for both $P_\\mathcal{T}^{(t+1)}$ and $P_\\mathcal{T}^{(t)}$ in that above relation. That is, it solves:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In effect, $\\pi_\\mathcal{T}$ is the distribution that $P_\\mathcal{T}^{(t)}$ converges too.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, we're ready for the big insight:\n",

    "\"\n",
    "We may choose our Markov Chain, $\\mathcal{T}$, such that $\\pi_\\mathcal{T} = P_M$\n",
    "\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, conceivably, we could make our choice of $\\mathcal{T}$ with $P_M$ in mind and solve for the stationary distribution to get our answer. However, in general, this isn't possible. Hence, we need our next 'MC'. That is, we'll use **Monte Carlo simulations** to solve our problem. Instead of trying to solve for $\\pi_\\mathcal{T}$, we execute the sampling procedure to produce a series of $\\mathbf{x}^{(t)}$'s, and then we observe an empirical approximation to $\\pi_\\mathcal{T}$ (and hence $P_M$) after a number of iterations. If we are concerned with a subset $\\mathbf{Y}$ from $\\mathcal{X}$, we simply select out the $\\mathbf{Y}$-elements from our series of $\\mathbf{x}^{(t)}$'s and use those.\n",

Cyclic behind like this means the Markov chain is periodic -  we hate periodic chains.\n",
    "* A $\\mathcal{T}$ with a low 'conductance' is one in which there are regions of the state space which are very hard to go between. This means that if you start in one, it'll take you an extremely long time before you explore the other. So we have a near-dependency on $P^{(0)}_\\mathcal{T}$. Also, convergence will require traversing that narrow bridge, so it certainly won't be 'quick'.

    "Our first step is to uniformly sample a $\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}$ from  $Val(\\mathcal{X})$. In Gibbs Sampling, our transition probabilities will be such that we are forced to change this vector *one element at a time* to produce our samples. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick out $X_1$ from $\\mathbf{X}$ and list out all values of $Val(X_1)$. For example, $Val(X_1)=[x_1^1,x_1^2,x_1^3,x_1^4]$.\n",
    "2. For each $x_1^i \\in Val(X_1)$, create a new vector by subbing that $x_1^i$ into the $X_1$-position of $\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}$ (call it $\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}_{i-subbed}$).\n",
    "3. Plug each $\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}_{i-subbed}$ into our Gibbs Rule[3], giving us 4 positive numbers and normalize them into probabilities.\n",
    "4. Randomly sample from this size-4 probability vector to give us one particular $x_1^i$. Plug that number into $\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}$ giving us $\\mathbf{x}^{(1)}$.\n",

At the other end, imagine there is no correlation - then we have our independence and we have as many independent samples as samples (beyond that 'large enough' $t$). So the effective sample size is a number between these two extremes. There exists some heuristics to estimate this figure from lagged correlations. It's an important figure to keep handy, as it gives you a clue as to how good our approximated inference is.\n",

    "### The Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue in Gibbs Sampling is that we move through the states very slowly. It would help if we could control how fast we explore this space. To guarantee that the resulting $\\pi_\\mathcal{T}$ equals our $P_M$, we'd have to apply a correction to compensate for that control. Roughly, this is the idea behind the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm.\n",

That is, it's defined over the same space ($Val(\\mathbf{X}))$ and is responsible for proposing the next state, given whatever current state. This is our opportunity to envoke large leaps. Our correction will be to sample a yes-no event according to a certain 'acceptance' probability. If we draw a yes, we transition to the proposed state. If we draw a no, we remain at the current state. This acceptance probability is specially design to ensure detailed balance. It is:\n",

    "For the intuiters, let's decompose $\\mathcal{A}$. It's effectively made up of $\\frac{\\tilde{P}_M(\\mathbf{x}')}{\\tilde{P}_M(\\mathbf{x})}$ and $\\frac{\\mathcal{T}^Q(\\mathbf{x}'\\rightarrow\\mathbf{x})}{\\mathcal{T}^Q(\\mathbf{x}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{x}')}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\tilde{P}_M(\\mathbf{x}')}{\\tilde{P}_M(\\mathbf{x})}$ makes us more likely to reject states that are unfavorable according to $P_M$. Notice it uses the unnormalized probabilities - no intractable $Z$ involved! Also, since it's a ratio involving the Gibbs Rule, if $\\mathbf{x}'$ and $\\mathbf{x}$ share some identical terms (maybe by design of our $\\mathcal{T}^Q$), it's possible some factors cancel. So we could save time by avoiding computation of the full Gibbs Rule.\n",

    "$\\frac{\\mathcal{T}^Q(\\mathbf{x}'\\rightarrow\\mathbf{x})}{\\mathcal{T}^Q(\\mathbf{x}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{x}')}$ makes us unlikely to accept states that are easy to transition to (according to our proposal) but difficult to return from. Such behavior is at odds with detailed balance, so it's curtailing it for that sake of this property.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, there are some practical considerations to keep in mind. First, $\\mathcal{T}^Q$ should be able to propose everything in $Val(\\mathbf{X})$, otherwise we'll give a zero probability to something $P_M$ might favor. Second, a rejected proposed sample is a waste of your computers time, so in this sense, we like high $\\mathcal{A}$'s. However, very high $\\mathcal{A}$'s might mean you aren't exploring the space quickly. Together, this means that $\\mathcal{T}^Q$ must be tuned right to explore the space efficiently."

We'll take it that we can evaluate the ratio of two samples of our intractable distribution. With that, we know how to generate proposals, accept/reject them and produce samples.
