    "(This is the 5th answer in a 7 part series [link] on Probabilistic Graphical Models ('PGMs'))\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, our starting point is that we've been given a PGM (of which a Bayesian Network (a 'BN') is an certain type), complete with fitted parameters. Here, we'll discover how to determine (i.e. to 'learn') those parameters from data. I'll say up front, this task for a BN is as friendly as parameter learning gets - that's why its our first destination. In doing so, we'll take a tour of the major considerations of parameter learning and their relatively simple solutions for a BN. When we're faced with more complicated parameter learning tasks, the approach here will serve as a useful framework to contextualize those difficulties.\n",

    "In the first answer [link], we discovered why PGMs are useful tools for representing complex system. We defined a complex system as a set of $n$ random variables (which we call $\\mathcal{X}$) with a relationship we'd like to understand. We take it that there exists some true but unknown joint distribution, $P$, which govern these random variables ('RVs'). We take it that a 'good understanding' means we can answer two types of questions regarding this $P$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Probability Queries**: Compute the probabilities $P(\\mathbf{Y}|\\mathbf{e})$. What is the distribution of the RV's of $\\mathbf{Y}$ given we have some observation ($\\mathbf{e}$) of the RVs of $\\mathbf{E}$?\n",
    "2. **MAP Queries**: Determine $\\textrm{argmax}_\\mathbf{Y}P(\\mathbf{Y}|\\mathbf{e})$. That is, determine the most likely values of some RVs given an assignment of other RVs.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Where $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{Y}$ are two arbitrary subsets of $\\mathcal{X}$. If this notation is unfamiliar, see the 'Notation Guide' section from the first answer [link]).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind PGMs is to estimate $P$ using two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A graph: a set of nodes, each of which represents an RV from $\\mathcal{X}$, and a set of edges between these nodes.\n",
    "2. Parameters: objects that, when paired with a graph and a certain rule, allow us to calculate probabilities of assignments of $\\mathcal{X}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the two main categories of PGM is the Bayesian Networks. A **Bayesian Network** involves a graph, denoted as $\\mathcal{G}$, with *directed* edges and no directed cycles. The parameters are Conditional Probability Tables ('CPDs' or 'CPTs'), which are, as the naming suggests, select conditional probabilities from the BN. They give us the right hand side of the Chain Rule, which dictates we calculate probabilities according to a BN:\n",

Here, we're concerned with a system of five RVs: a student's intelligence ($I$), their class's difficulty ($D$), their grade in that class ($G$), their letter of recommendation ($L$) and their SAT score ($S$).

Later, we'll relax this assumption and consequently, ruin our lives. \n",

A likelihood function accepts parameters and returns a number that tells us how *likely* a fixed set of data is according to those parameters. The guiding principle is to pick parameters that maximize this function, i.e. the likelihood of our data. Such parameters are called our **Maximum Likelihood Estimate ('MLE').** To write this out, it's typical to say $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is a vector that lists out our parameters that our likelihood function is $\\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$. Further, the argmax of such a function is the same as the argmax of the *log* of this function, and since log-ing turns difficult multiplication into easy addition, we maximize the log likelihood, $\\log \\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$. In the case of a BN, this function accepts a vector of parameters, uses them to form the CPDs, calculates each data point's log probability according to the Chain Rule, and returns the sum of these numbers.
