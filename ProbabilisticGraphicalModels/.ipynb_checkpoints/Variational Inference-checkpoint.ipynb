We defined a complex system as a set of $n$ random variables (which we call $\\mathcal{X}$) with a relationship we'd like to understand. We take it that there exists some true but unknown joint distribution, $P$, which govern these RVs. We take it that a 'good understanding' means we can answer two types of questions regarding this $P$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Probability Queries**: Compute the probabilities $P(\\mathbf{Y}|\\mathbf{e})$. What is the distribution of the RV's of $\\mathbf{Y}$ given we have some observation ($\\mathbf{e}$) of the RVs of $\\mathbf{E}$?\n",
    "2. **MAP Queries**: Determine $\\textrm{argmax}_\\mathbf{Y}P(\\mathbf{Y}|\\mathbf{e})$. That is, determine the most likely values of some RVs given an assignment of other RVs.\n",

    "\n",
    "The idea behind PGMs is to estimate $P$ using two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A graph: a set of nodes, each of which represents an RV from $\\mathcal{X}$, and a set of edges between these nodes.\n",
    "2. Parameters: objects that, when paired with a graph and a certain rule, allow us to calculate probabilities of assignments of $\\mathcal{X}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "PGMs fall into two main categories, Bayesian Networks ('BNs') and Markov Networks ('MNs'), depending on the specifics of these two.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Bayesian Network** involves a graph, denoted as $\\mathcal{G}$, with *directed* edges and no directed cycles. The parameters are Conditional Probability Tables ('CPDs' or 'CPTs'), which are, as the naming suggests, select conditional probabilities from the BN. They give us the right hand side of the Chain Rule, which dictates we calculate probabilities according to a BN:\n",

The parameters are a size $m$ set of *functions* which map assignments of $m$ subsets of $\\mathcal{X}$ to nonnegative numbers. Those subsets, which we'll call $\\mathbf{D}_i$'s, correspond to *complete subgraphs* of $\\mathcal{H}$ and their union makes up the whole of $\\mathcal{H}$. We can refer to this set as $\\Phi=\\{\\phi_i(\\cdots)\\}_{i=1}^m$. With that, we say that the 'Gibbs Rule' for calculation probabilities is:\n",

    "\n",
    "![Title](GIbbsTable_labeled.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we recall that the Gibbs Rule may expression the Chain Rule. That is, we can always recreate the probabilities produced by a BN's Chain Rule with an another invented MN and its Gibbs Rule. Essentially, we define factors as those that reproduce looking up a conditional probability in a BN's CPDs. This equivalence allows us to reason solely in terms of the Gibbs Rule, while assured that whatever we discover will also hold for BNs. In other words, with regards to inference, if something works for $P_M$, then it works for $P_B$."
