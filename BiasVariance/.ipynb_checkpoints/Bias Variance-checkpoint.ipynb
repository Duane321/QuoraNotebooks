    "The bias-variance tradeoff is often misunderstood and misused. Though, it's not terribly surprising - the component terms 'bias' and 'variance' are frequently used in related-but-different ideas. The fact is, however, that this tradeoff refers to something very specific with a singular goal: generalization of a model's predictive performance. So here, I'll attempt to make that as clear as day, by addressing two questions:\n",
